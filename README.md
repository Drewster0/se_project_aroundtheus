Around The U.S.

This project was made to display different destonations that have been explored or traveled to. The website is made to alter layout according to the different screen sizes on various devices. The location listed will compress to smaller amounts of columns as the screen size decreses while the profile changes layouts to better suit the smaller screens of mobile devices.

The techniques used to achieve this responsive design include various percentages given as values rather than hard pixels. Flexboxes and grids were used to group and arrange certain elements within some of the sections to allow for movement as the screen size decreses.
